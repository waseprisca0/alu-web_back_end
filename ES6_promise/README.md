# Promises
his project explores the implementation of Promises, async functions, and necessary setup using Node.js, Jest, Babel, and ESLint.

Promises
Promises are used extensively in this project to handle asynchronous operations. They utilize the then, resolve, and catch methods to manage the flow of asynchronous tasks. Each Promise method is employed to ensure robust error handling and efficient task completion.

Async Functions
The await operator is crucial for managing asynchronous functions, ensuring that tasks wait for promises to resolve before proceeding. Async functions are structured to handle complex tasks effectively and asynchronously.
